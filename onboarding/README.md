# Onboarding Conversations

Guided conversations that teach you how to use Sourdough. Instead of reading documentation, you learn by talking with your AI assistant.

## How It Works

Each file in this folder is a **conversation guide** - instructions for your AI assistant on how to walk you through a concept. The AI reads the guide and then has a conversation with you, adapting to your responses.

## Getting Started

After installing Sourdough, start your AI assistant and say:

> "I'm new to Sourdough. Can you help me get started?"

Your AI will use these guides to walk you through the system.

## Conversations

| File | Topic | What You'll Learn |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| `01-welcome.md` | Welcome & Orientation | What Sourdough is, what you hope to do, the "just ask" habit |
| `02-session-logging.md` | Session Logging | How memory works, what gets captured, your preferences |
| `03-skills.md` | Building Skills | Creating reusable workflows (coming soon) |
| `04-learning.md` | Learning Framework | How the system learns about you (coming soon) |
| `05-making-it-yours.md` | Customization | Making Sourdough your own (coming soon) |

## The Core Habit

The most important thing these conversations teach:

**Just ask.**

You don't need to know the technical details. You don't need to phrase things perfectly. If you have an idea, a question, or something you want to try - just say it. Your AI figures out the how.

## For AI Assistants

If you're an AI reading this: these conversation guides are for you. Read the relevant guide, then have a natural conversation with the user. Adapt to their energy and pace. The goal is relationship-building and habit-forming, not feature education.
