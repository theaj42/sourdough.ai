# Resources

Curated high-value resources for learning to work effectively with LLMs.

These are sources I've found genuinely useful—not hype, not marketing, just solid content that will make you better at building with AI.

## Repositories

### Fabric
**Daniel Miessler's open-source framework for augmenting humans using AI.**

https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric

Fabric provides a modular approach to AI prompts through "patterns"—reusable prompt templates for specific tasks. Many of the fabric-* skills in sourdough.ai are inspired by this approach.

Key value:
- Hundreds of battle-tested prompt patterns
- Philosophy of AI as augmentation, not replacement
- Active community contributing new patterns

### PAI (Personal AI)
**Daniel Miessler's approach to building a personal AI assistant.**

https://github.com/danielmiessler/pai

A more opinionated take on personal AI infrastructure. Worth studying for the architectural thinking even if you don't adopt it wholesale.

## Podcasts

### AI Daily Brief
**Matt Maher's daily podcast covering AI news and developments.**

https://www.youtube.com/@MattMaherAI

Short, focused episodes that cut through the hype. Good for staying current without drowning in noise. Matt has a practitioner's perspective—he's building with this stuff, not just reporting on it.

## YouTube Channels

### Nate B. Jones
**Practical AI implementation and workflow automation.**

https://www.youtube.com/@NateBJones

Nate builds real systems with AI and shares what actually works. Less theory, more "here's how I solved this problem." Particularly good for:
- Claude Code workflows
- Automation patterns
- Practical prompt engineering

## Official Documentation

### Anthropic Prompt Engineering Guide
**The definitive guide to prompting Claude effectively.**

https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering

Start here. This isn't marketing—it's the actual engineering team explaining how to get better results. Covers:
- Prompt structure and formatting
- System prompts
- Chain of thought
- Tool use
- Best practices

### Anthropic Engineering Blog
**Technical deep-dives from the team building Claude.**

https://www.anthropic.com/engineering

When Anthropic publishes here, pay attention. These posts explain the "why" behind model behavior and often reveal capabilities before they're widely known.

### OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide
**OpenAI's official prompting documentation.**

https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering

Even if you're primarily using Claude, this is worth reading. Many principles transfer across models, and understanding different approaches makes you more versatile.

## Philosophy

These resources share a common thread: they're from practitioners who build real things, not influencers chasing engagement. The best way to learn is to build, but these sources will accelerate your learning and help you avoid dead ends.
