## Part 3: Your Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

Here's what to do right away:

### 1. Apply to a Real Project

Pick something you actually need to do and use AI to help:
- A work project
- A personal automation
- Learning something new
- Organizing your files

**Why now**: Real problems teach more than examples ever could.

### 2. Create Your First Custom Skill

Think of something you do regularly and make a skill for it:
- Daily standup report
- Project status check
- Code review checklist
- Your own idea

**Why now**: Skills multiply your efficiency. The sooner you start, the sooner you benefit.

### 3. Start Session Logging

Begin documenting your work:
- Create today's log
- Note what you've accomplished
- Record next actions
- Read it next session

**Why now**: This builds the habit while it's fresh. Future you will be grateful.

### 4. Customize Your CLAUDE.md

If you haven't already, create or update `~/ai-data/CLAUDE.md`:
- Add context about yourself
- State your preferences
- Define your working style
- Update as you discover more

**Why now**: The sooner AI knows your preferences, the better it serves you.

### Try This

Let's plan your first real project. Think about what you want to work on, then tell me:

"I want to use AI to help me with [your project]"

We'll talk through the approach and get you started.

**Go ahead—what do you want to work on first?**

**[PAUSE - Wait for user to describe their first project. Discuss the approach: what skills might help, how to organize it, what safety considerations matter, and what the first steps would be. Be enthusiastic and encouraging. Help them feel confident about starting. Then continue.]**
