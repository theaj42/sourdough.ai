- Contribute improvements

## Common Questions at This Point

### "Am I ready to use this for real work?"

Yes! You understand the fundamentals. Start with:
- Non-critical projects first
- Use version control
- Review AI changes
- Build confidence gradually

### "What if I get stuck?"

- Ask AI for help (seriously!)
- Review relevant lessons
- Check documentation
- Try a different approach
- Take a break and come back

### "How long until this feels natural?"

Most people report:
- Week 1-2: Still learning
- Week 3-4: Getting comfortable
- Month 2: Feels natural
- Month 3+: Can't imagine working without it

**Your timeline may vary—that's normal.**

### "Should I learn everything in the engine/ directory?"

Only if you're interested in:
- Building agents
- Creating integrations
- Extending the framework
- Deep customization

**Most users never touch engine/ code.** The skills and documentation are the primary interface.

### "What about MCP servers and ChromaDB?"

Those are **Phase 2** (out of scope for MVP). For now:
- Skills system is sufficient
- Session logs provide memory
- Learning framework captures patterns

Future versions may add these capabilities.

## The Sourdough Philosophy

Remember the core principles:

**Build over plan**: Don't over-engineer, just start
**Organic evolution**: Let your system grow naturally
**Learn by doing**: Experience teaches better than reading
**Your AI, your way**: Customize to fit you

## Your Unique Culture

Just like sourdough starter:
- Everyone starts with the same framework
- Each person's develops differently
- Your preferences shape it
- Your skills customize it
- Your learnings personalize it

**Result**: An AI assistant that works the way *you* work.

## Final Thoughts

You've completed the lessons, but **the real learning starts now**.

As you use sourdough:
- You'll discover new patterns
- You'll create better skills
- You'll refine your workflow
- You'll develop your own best practices

**This is a journey, not a destination.**

## What Makes Sourdough Different

Unlike other AI tools:
- **It learns you**: Via learning framework
- **It remembers**: Via session logs
- **It's extensible**: Via skills system
- **It's yours**: Local, private, personal

This isn't just using AI—it's **AI augmentation**.

## One Last Practice

Let's close with reflection:

**Try**: "Create a session log entry for completing Lessons 1-14"

Document what you've learned, what stood out, and what you want to try first.

This is your starting point.
