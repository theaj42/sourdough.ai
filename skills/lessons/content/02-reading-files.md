# Lesson 2: Reading Files

Now that you know how to have a conversation with AI, let's explore one of the most powerful capabilities: **reading and understanding files**.

## What You'll Learn

- How AI can read any text file on your system
- Why this is incredibly useful
- How to point AI to files you want help with
- What AI can do once it reads a file

---

## Part 1: The Power of Reading

When I can read files, I can:
- Explain what code does
- Summarize documentation
- Find specific information in logs
- Review configuration files
- Compare multiple files
- Debug issues by reading error messages

This is **much more powerful** than you might think. Instead of you reading a 200-line config file to find one setting, just ask me to find it.

### Try This

Let's try reading a file together.

**Ask me**: "Read the README file in my sourdough.ai directory"

Watch what I do—I'll use the Read tool to open and understand the entire file.

**[PAUSE - Wait for user to ask me to read the README. Once I read it, acknowledge what I did ("I've read the README file - it's about [brief summary]"), then continue.]**

---

## Part 2: What Just Happened

Nice! Here's what happened when you asked me to read that file:
- I used the Read tool to open `~/sourdough.ai/README.md`
- I didn't just skim it—I read and understood **all of it**
- I can now answer questions about anything in that file
- I can reference specific parts and explain concepts from it

### Try This

Now that I've read the README, ask me a question about it:
- "What's the sourdough metaphor about?"
- "Explain the architecture"
- "What does it say about skills?"

Pick one and try it!

**[PAUSE - Wait for user to ask a question about the README. Answer their specific question, then continue.]**

---

Great! See how that works? Once I read a file, I can answer questions about it, explain concepts from it, and reference specific parts.

## Part 3: Different File Types

I can read all kinds of files:
- **Text files**: .txt, .md, .log
- **Code**: .py, .js, .sh, .ps1, .java, etc.
- **Config files**: .yaml, .json, .toml, .env
- **Documentation**: README, CHANGELOG, etc.
- **Data files**: .csv, .xml, etc.

I can even read **images** and **PDFs** (I'll describe what I see or extract text).

### Try This

Let's practice with different types of files. Try asking me to:

1. "Read the getting-started.md file in the docs directory"
2. "What does it say about installation?"
3. "Read the hello-world skill and explain how skills work"

Pick one and give it a try!

**[PAUSE - Wait for user to try reading different files and asking questions. Help them with each request. When they've experimented enough or want to move on, continue.]**

## Part 4: Practical Examples

Good! Now you've seen how reading works. Let me show you some real-world examples of what this enables:

**Understanding Code**:
"Read install.sh and explain what it does" → I'll explain the setup process step by step

**Finding Information**:
"Read my session log from today and tell me what I worked on" → I'll summarize your activities

**Debugging**:
"Read the error log and help me figure out what went wrong" → I'll identify the error and suggest fixes

### How to Point Me to Files

You can specify files several ways:
- **Absolute path**: `/Users/yourname/sourdough.ai/README.md`
- **Relative path**: `~/sourdough.ai/README.md` (~ means your home directory)
- **Shorthand**: "the README in sourdough.ai" (I'll figure out the full path)

## Wrap-Up: You've Got This

Great work! You've learned how AI can read and understand files.

### Key Takeaways

✅ I can read and understand any text-based file
✅ You control what I read by pointing me to specific files
✅ Once I read a file, I can explain it, summarize it, or answer questions about it
✅ Reading files is the foundation for editing files (next lesson!)
✅ Your privacy is protected—I only see what you show me

### Important to Remember

**Privacy**: I can only read files you tell me to read. I don't scan your entire system. You're in control of what I can access.

**Multiple files**: I can read several files at once if you need me to compare or understand a project.

**Memory**: I only remember files from our current conversation unless we use session logging (you'll learn about that later).

### Questions?

Common questions at this point:
- "Can you read binary files?" (Sort of—I can describe them but can't execute them)
- "Is there a limit to file size?" (Very large files might be truncated, but I'll tell you)
- "Do you remember files after the conversation ends?" (Only if we log the session)

**Any other questions?** Ask away!

## Next Steps

**Ready for Lesson 3?**
Next, we'll learn about creating files—having AI write files for you. This builds directly on reading files.

**Want more practice first?**
Try reading a few more files to get comfortable. Say "continue lessons" whenever you're ready for Lesson 3.

**Progress**: Lesson 2 of 14 complete 🎉

*Remember: Reading files is a foundational skill. Everything else builds on this!*
