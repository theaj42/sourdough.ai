# Lesson 1: Welcome & First Conversation

Welcome to sourdough.ai! You're about to learn something that will change how you work with computers: **conversational collaboration with AI**.

## What You'll Learn

- How to talk naturally with AI assistants
- What AI can and can't do
- The basics of asking for help
- How to get useful responses

## Let's Start Simple

Right now, you're already having a conversation with an AI assistant (me!). That's the foundation of everything else.

### Try This

Ask me a question. Any question. Try:
- "What files are in my home directory?"
- "What's the weather like?" (I can search the web)
- "Explain what sourdough.ai does"
- "Help me understand how you work"

Go ahead, try one now. I'll wait.

## How Conversations Work

Here's what just happened (or will happen when you ask):

1. **You asked** in natural language
2. **I understood** the intent
3. **I took action** (checked files, searched web, explained something)
4. **I responded** with results

No special syntax. No commands to memorize. Just conversation.

## What Makes a Good Question?

**Good questions**:
- "Can you read the README file in my sourdough.ai directory?"
- "Show me what's in my ai-data folder"
- "Help me understand what session logging means"

**Less helpful questions**:
- "Do stuff" (too vague)
- "Fix it" (fix what?)
- "You know what I mean" (I might not!)

The more specific you are, the better I can help.

## What AI Can Do

In this system, I can:
- Read files you point me to
- Write new files
- Edit existing files
- Run bash commands (Mac/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows)
- Search the web for information
- Remember context from our conversation
- Explain concepts and answer questions

## What AI Can't Do

I can't:
- Read your mind (be specific!)
- Access files without permission
- Know what you haven't told me
- Remember everything from past conversations (unless logged)
- Make perfect decisions without your guidance

## The Key Insight

This isn't about AI replacing you. It's about **AI augmenting you**. Think of it like:
- You're the chef
- I'm your sous chef
- You decide what to make
- I help with the prep work

## Let's Practice

Try asking me to do a few things:
1. "List the files in my sourdough.ai directory"
2. "What's in the README file?"
3. "Show me what skills are available"

See how natural it is? That's the point.

## Key Takeaways

- Talk to AI like you'd talk to a helpful colleague
- Be specific about what you want
- AI augments your abilities, doesn't replace them
- The more you practice, the better you'll get at working together

## Questions?

This is a good time to ask anything that's confusing. Common questions:
- "How do you actually work?" (Happy to explain the technical side)
- "Is my data private?" (Yes, everything stays local unless you explicitly ask me to reach out to the web)
- "What happens if you make a mistake?" (You can always undo changes, and I'll help fix it)

**Ready for Lesson 2?** Next, we'll explore how I can read and understand files on your system.

Or take a break and come back later. Say "continue lessons" whenever you're ready.
