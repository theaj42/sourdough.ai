# Lesson 1: Welcome & First Conversation

Welcome to sourdough.ai! You're about to learn something that will change how you work with computers: **conversational collaboration with AI**.

## What You'll Learn

- How to talk naturally with AI assistants
- What AI can and can't do
- The basics of asking for help
- How to get useful responses

---

## Part 1: Your First Question

Right now, you're already having a conversation with an AI assistant (me!). That's the foundation of everything else.

The most important thing to understand: **there's no special syntax**. You just talk to me like you'd talk to a helpful colleague.

### Try This

Ask me any question. Anything you're curious about. Here are some ideas:
- "What files are in my home directory?"
- "What's the weather like?" (I can search the web)
- "Explain what sourdough.ai does"
- "Help me understand how you work"

**Go ahead—try one now.** I'll wait here and respond when you ask.

**[PAUSE - Wait for user to ask a question, then respond to it with specific feedback about what they asked and how it worked. Then continue.]**

---

Nice! See how natural that was? No commands to memorize, no syntax to learn. Just conversation.

## Part 2: How This Actually Works

Here's what just happened when you asked your question:

1. **You asked** in natural language (no special format needed)
2. **I understood** the intent (what you actually wanted)
3. **I took action** (read a file, searched the web, explained something)
4. **I responded** with results

This is the whole pattern. Everything else builds on this.

### What Makes Questions Work Well

**Specific questions work better**:
- ✅ "Can you read the README file in my sourdough.ai directory?"
- ✅ "Show me what's in my ai-data folder"
- ✅ "Help me understand what session logging means"

**Vague questions are harder**:
- ❌ "Do stuff" (what stuff?)
- ❌ "Fix it" (fix what?)
- ❌ "You know what I mean" (I might not!)

The more specific you are, the better I can help. But don't worry—if I don't understand, I'll ask clarifying questions.

## Part 3: Understanding What AI Can Do

Let me show you what's actually possible in this system.

### I Can:
- **Read files** you point me to
- **Write new files** when you need them created
- **Edit existing files** with precise changes
- **Run commands** (bash on Mac/Linux, PowerShell on Windows)
- **Search the web** for information
- **Remember context** from our conversation
- **Explain concepts** and answer questions

### I Can't:
- **Read your mind** (please be specific!)
- **Access files** without you telling me to
- **Know things** you haven't told me
- **Remember past conversations** automatically (unless we're logging—you'll learn about that in Lesson 10)
- **Make perfect decisions** without your guidance

### The Key Philosophy

This isn't about AI replacing you. It's about **AI augmenting you**.

Think of it like this:
- **You're the chef** - you decide what to make
- **I'm your sous chef** - I help with the prep work
- **Together we cook faster** - but you're still in charge

## Part 4: Let's Practice

Time to try a few things to get comfortable.

###Try these three questions (one at a time):

1. "List the files in my sourdough.ai directory"
2. "What's in the README file?"
3. "Show me what skills are available"

**Go ahead—try them now.** I'll respond to each one, and we can talk about what happened.

**[PAUSE - Wait for user to try the exercises. Respond to each thing they try with specific feedback. Encourage them. If they get stuck or ask questions, help them. When they've tried the exercises (or decided they're ready to move on), continue to wrap-up.]**

---

## Wrap-Up: You've Got This

Great work! You've just learned the single most important concept: **talking to AI is just... talking.**

### Key Takeaways

✅ Talk to AI like you'd talk to a helpful colleague
✅ Be specific about what you want
✅ AI augments your abilities—you're still in charge
✅ The more you practice, the better you'll both get at working together

### Common Questions

Before we finish, here are answers to questions new users often have:

**"How do you actually work?"**
I'm an AI language model that can use tools (read files, run commands, search the web). When you ask me to do something, I figure out which tools to use and how to use them.

**"Is my data private?"**
Yes. Everything stays on your local machine unless you explicitly ask me to reach out to the web. I can't access anything you don't point me to.

**"What if you make a mistake?"**
You can always undo changes. And I'll help you fix anything that goes wrong. That's what the next lessons are about—doing things safely.

**Any other questions?** Ask away! This is a good time.

## Next Steps

**Ready for Lesson 2?**
Next, we'll explore how I can read and understand files on your system. You'll learn when and why to have AI read files, and how to do it safely.

**Need more practice first?**
That's totally fine! Try asking me to do a few more things. Experiment. Get comfortable. Say "continue lessons" whenever you're ready for Lesson 2.

**Want to take a break?**
No problem. Your progress is saved. Just say "continue lessons" next time and we'll pick up right here.

*Remember: The best way to learn is by doing. Don't just read—actually try things!*
